## The Problem
The Master Caddy enclosure is a great product that offers physical protection for low cost storage devices used when filming. With the official reader for this device being discontinued, there is no great way to read these drives with out putting force on the fragile sata connection. This is a problem for both longevity and data protection. 

## The Solution
In order to read numerous drives at once and organize them in the best configuration, a 1u rack enclosure will be made to read 4 drives at once allowing for offload of the drive at once. This will ensure that the data is backed up as fast as possible and lead to less time worrying about having data in a single place.
